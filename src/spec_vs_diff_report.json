  "summary": "Frontend-side diagnostics, guarded actor calls, and user-facing error normalization were added. However, the diff shows no backend Motoko changes, so restoring missing canister functions / Candid parity is not evidenced. The REQ-11 “reproduce and capture exact runtime errors” outcome is also not evidenced; the added doc describes a diagnostics approach and generic patterns but does not capture actual observed console errors from the deployed app.",

      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Identify which backend canister functions are reported as “missing” after the latest deployment by reproducing the issue in the running app and capturing the exact console/runtime errors, producing a clear list of missing/broken functions and reproduction steps.",
      "reason": "The diff adds a diagnostics utility and a documentation file with generic guidance and a table marked as all methods present, but it does not include captured real console/runtime error strings from an actual reproduction, nor a confirmed list of actually-missing functions from the latest deployment.",

      "reason": "No backend canister changes are shown in the diff summary (no edits to backend/main.mo or any backend files). The frontend adds guards to detect missing methods, but that does not restore the backend API or Candid interface parity.",
